U.S. Representative Filemon Vela, of Brownsville, has been called the most outspoken Texas Democrat. Tune in via livestream to watch the Texas Tribune's discussion with him. The event begins Monday morning at 8 AM, or you can catch the archive later tomorrow.


In 2013, Rep. Vela resigned from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in protest of a bill that would have required additional border fences to secure pathways to citizenship for immigrants. Rep. Vela stated that "erecting more border fence drives a wedge between border communities which are culturally united," a position that will take on even more significance under the current administration.

You can watch the discussion live [here at 8 AM]( https://www.texastribune.org/events/2017/02/13/a-conversation-with-us-rep-filemon-vela/).(Or check the link for the archive later tomorrow.)
