The Texas Legislature is currently focusing its energies on budget hearings and emergency items designated by the Governor at last week's State of the State address which you can see in full detail here: https://www.texastribune.org/2017/01/31/state-state-abbott-lays-out-predictable-agenda/

Last week, the Senate State Affairs Committee heard more than 16 hours of public testimony on Senate Bill 4, which would require all state and local entities to comply with federal immigration laws. The bill would put an end to so-called "sanctuary cities." The State Affairs Committee ultimately voted 7-2, on party lines, to move the bill to the Senate floor. The entire Senate will vote on the bill this week.

Governor Abbott has already taken $1.5 million in state funding from Travis County after Sheriff Sally Hernandez enacted a policy not to cooperate with federal immigration detainers.

Call your state senator and tell them to vote against SB 4. Here's our suggested language:

Hi. My name is ______, and I am a concerned constituent from your district. I'm calling to ask you to vote against SB 4. The bill does nothing to keep us safe. Authority should remain with local law enforcement, who know best how to keep their cities safe. I urge {!custom State Senator Name} to vote against SB 4 this week. Thank you for your time.

Here's the contact information for your state senator: {!custom State Senator Name} Phone Number: {!custom State Senator PH Number}

Follow the conversation on Twitter using #SB4 to stay up to date on the latest developments for the sanctuary city bill.
